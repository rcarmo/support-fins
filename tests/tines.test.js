// docs/FIN-SPEC.md: a tine is a tiny HORIZONTAL bridge that fuses INTO the part.
// Horizontal so it prints as one continuous layer line; into the part because
// that bite is the grip ("combined support"). The two ways it has broken:
//   - stood PROUD of the wall's flanks -> flat tabs sticking out sideways,
//     "laying on the piece" instead of biting in;
//   - hung BELOW the contact -> a tall tooth, not a one-layer bridge.
// These tests pin emitTines directly on a controlled solid so both stay caught.
