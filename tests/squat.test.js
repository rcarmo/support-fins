// Squat bed props: near-bed overhangs too low for a flanged breakaway wall.

// A full T-wall needs ~minHeight of headroom just to exist (gap + base flange +
// tip taper), so before this the sub-minHeight stations of a low overhang were
// trimmed as stub/blocked and the ledge printed into air -- the near-bed band on
// real organic parts that came out rough. `lowledge` is that case distilled: a
// thin tongue whose underside sits ~1mm above the plate. These lock the promise
// that it now gets a FLANGELESS squat wall that (a) actually appears, (b) stays
// squat, (c) is watertight, and (d) never fuses into the part.
